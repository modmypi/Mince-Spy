# Mince-Spy
A secret Mince Pie Spying project build... keep an eye on your Mince Pie and check when Santa has arrived! This code is for use with the [Project Mince Spy](https://www.modmypi.com/project-mince-spy) blog and a [PiBorg TroPi LED Board](https://www.piborg.org/tropi).

The code files contained in this repo are as follows:

- `mince_spy_alert.py` - The code to be used in an external Raspberry Pi Zero with a TroPi board attached.
- `mince_spy_latch.py` - The code to be used with the latch circuit and the external Raspberry Pi code in mince_spy_alert.py.
- `mince_spy_solo.py` - The code to be used with a single Raspberry Pi attached directly to the circuit, no external Pi required.

Read the blog, get involved, and build your own Santa Catcher!
