# Mince-Spy
A secret Mince Pie Spying project build... keep an eye on your Mince Pie and check when Santa has arrived! This code is for use with the [Project Mince Spy](https://www.modmypi.com/project-mince-spy) blog and a [PiBorg TroPi LED Board](https://www.piborg.org/tropi).

The code files contained in this repo are as follows:

- `mincespyalert.py` - The code to be used in an external Raspberry Pi Zero with a TroPi board attached.
- `mincespylatch.py` - The code to be used with the latch circuit and the external Raspberry Pi code in mincespyalert.py.
- `mincespysolo.py` - The code to be used with a single Raspberry Pi attached directly to the circuit, no external Pi required.
